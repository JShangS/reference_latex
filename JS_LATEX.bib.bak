  abstract = {In this correspondence, we deal with the problem of detecting the signal of interest in the presence of Gaussian clutter with symmetric spectrum. In particular, we consider the so-called partially homogeneous environment (PHE), where the cell under test and the training samples, share the same covariance matrix up to an unknown power scaling factor. At the design stage, we exploit the spectral properties of the clutter to transfer the data from the complex to the real domain. Then, we derive two adaptive detectors relying on the Rao test and a suitable modification of the generalized likelihood ratio test. The performance assessments, conducted on both simulated data and real recorded datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly proposed detectors compared with the traditional state-of-the-art counterparts, which ignore the spectrum symmetry. Finally, they can ensure better detection performance than the existing symmetric spectrum detector derived for PHE.},

The covariance matrix estimation is modeled as a general linear combination of prior covariance matrix and sample covariance matrix. Within this consideration, we obtain an adaptive detector based on the generalized likelihood ratio test. Experimental results on simulation and real data demonstrate that the proposed detector achieves better performance than the existing one-step GLRT (1S-GLRT) detectors when the secondary data are insufficient.},

  abstract = {This paper mainly deals with distributed targets detection with a polarimetric MIMO radar against compound-Gaussian clutter dominated scenario with unknown covariance matrix. First, the general polarimetric detecting problem of the distributed targets is developed to the MIMO radar, and then, the fully adaptive Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) is devised according to the well known two-step design procedure. Three covariance matrix estimation strategies using the secondary data are introduced to make derived receiver fully adaptive. A thorough performance assessment is given, and via several numerical examples, the results highlight that the spatial and polarization diversities can be exploited to improve the detection performance of the distributed targets in compound-Gaussian background, and it outperforms the phased-array counterpart, the adaptive loss is completely acceptable in practical applications. Meanwhile, the fixed-point estimation strategy is more suitable to implement the adaptive detection algorithm.},
