  abstract      = {In this paper, we consider the problem of multichannel radar signal detection in interference and structure nonhomogeneity. The interference is often caused by electromagnetic countermeasure (ECM) systems or industrial activity, while the nonhomogeneity usually arises because of rapid variations in terrain or radar antenna structure. We propose three adaptive detectors according to three common criteria of detector design, namely, the generalized likelihood ratio test ({GLRT}), Rao test, and Wald test. Extensive performance comparisons are conducted under different scenarios. It is shown that when the nonhomogeneity is severe, the detector devised according to the {GLRT} achieves the best detection performance. In other scenarios, the detector designed according to the Wald test may be the best choice, which has the highest probability of detection.},

  abstract      = {Space-time adaptive processing ({STAP}) is a crucial technique for the new generation airborne radar for Doppler spread compensation caused by the platform motion. We here propose to apply range cell snapshots-based recursive algorithms in order to reduce the computational complexity of the conventional {STAP} algorithms and to deal with a possible nonhomogeneity of the data samples. Subspace tracking algorithms as PAST, PASTd, OPAST, and more recently the fast approximate power iteration (FAPI) algorithm, which are time-based recursive algorithms initially introduced in spectral analysis, array processing, are good candidates. In this paper, we more precisely investigate the performance of FAPI for interference suppression in {STAP} radar. Extensive simulations demonstrate the outperformance of FAPI algorithm over other subspace trackers of similar computational complexity. We demonstrate also its effectiveness using measured data from the multichannel radar measurements (MCARM) program.},
